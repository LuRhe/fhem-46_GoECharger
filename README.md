FHEM - Modul 46_GoECharger


Module purpose:

 - controlling go-ECharger wallboxes via FHEM ( EV charger made by go-e® GmbH , https://go-e.co/ )
 - with this module it's possible to read data and set some functions of the wallbox 
   to monitor and control car battery charging

More Help:

 - after installation use device specific help;
 - before installation you may look into the .pm code file (near the end);
 - generic reference about go-eCharger API is available at go-e website and github via search
 - german FHEM forum https://forum.fhem.de/index.php/topic,110282.msg1129798.html#msg1129798

Last changes: 

- Attribute 'used_api_keys' and related code & help corrected  to the keywors default, minimal, all.
- To correct the kW_charging_measured value (there are uncalibrated voltage meter IC's) now there's an attribute "kW_measured_corr_value" as factor (often between 1.03 ... 1.07). You may measure the real charging power consumption with car or external power meter to determine a value other than the default 1 (if needed).


I'm not responsible in case of any unexpected behaviours, failures, damages. That's not a deep inspected, reviewed or monitored software. It's an open source tool in relation to a proprietary commercial product: the product or it's API may be in change by future deliveries or firmware updates. Feel free to inspect and adopt the code.
